			purpose = <"To record a persistent and managed list of immunisations that have been administered to an individual over time and to enable sharing of a immunisation list to other healthcare providers.">

The intent of this archetype is to be a generic container for any Immunisation list, which may have a specific context or limitation of scope set within a template. This list can be utilised as a source of immunisation data for an active current immunisation list within a clinical system, for transition of care, data exchange, or as the basis for decision support. 

This list can be comprised of three types of archetype:
- statements about the positive administration of immunisations are recorded using the ACTION.medication archetypes; OR
- a positive statement about the general exclusion of immunisation administration can be recorded using the general EVALUATION.exclusion_global archetype - for example: \"Never received any immunisations\"; OR
- a positive statement about the exclusion of use of a specific medication can be recorded using the EVALUATION.exclusion_specific archetype - for example: \"Never received Hepatitis B immunisation\": OR
- a positive statement about no information being available - neither positive known administrations of immunisations nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.

In order for a Immunisation list to be accurate and safe to use as the basis for decision support activities and for exchange, this Immunisation list should ideally be curated by a clinician responsible for the health record, rather than managed automatically by the clinical system through business rules alone.

In local systems it is possible to generate a list of immunisations by querying the database for all ACTION.medication archetypes that have been used to record immunisations. However this list is useful to support exchange of a local immunisation list with other healthcare.

This archetype is intended to be represented and managed as a persistent list, however there are situations where the list may be used within episodic care and require additional attributes such as context etc to enable accurate recording. The openEHR reference model currently only allows context to be recorded within Event-based COMPOSITION archetypes. As a result, this archetype has been modelled as an Event, rather than Persistent, COMPOSITION, to allow for flexibility so that some clinical systems can safely manage Immunisation lists for episodes of care, while others will choose to implement this COMPOSITION to act in a persistent manner.">
