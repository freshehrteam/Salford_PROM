## COPD Self Reporting to openEHR FLAT JSON PROMS Mapping guidance

29 June-2018
V2.0.0

### Introduction

This document describes the mappings between in input COPD Self Reporting XML document and an output openEHR Marand FLAT JSON document.

When describing the JSON target we have used 'handlebar' {{}} type notation to show how the source datapoint is mapped/substituted into the JSON document.

e.g.

```json
	"copd_self_reported_observations/heart_rate/any_event:0/heart_rate|magnitude":  {{value}},
```

where `value` is the value of of the source `value` attribute.

#### Outstanding issues

- We do not have an example of an actual COPD xml instance so have been working a little blind in terms of readcode mappings and other tags in the incoming xml but have made a best guess.

- We have pulled in the alerted tag as a simple textual comment. It would be possible to do something smarter if required but the use of this attribute is not clear


#### XML Source: `patient`

```XML
<patient ident='99928'>
```

`patient` is not mapped as this demographics information is not held in the openEHR CDR.

`Patient/ident` should be used to identify the patient and then look up their openEHR `ehrId` via the CDR API.

#### XML source: `protocol/testid`
```xml
     <protocol name='NHS Health Check' testid='106'>
```

This is not mapped but can be done easily so if required

Target JSON Header

##### Example mapping:
```json
"ctx/language": "en",
"ctx/territory": "GB",
"ctx/composer_name": "COPD Self Reporting",
"ctx/time": "{{Now()}}",
"ctx/id_namespace": "HOSPITAL-NS",
"ctx/id_scheme": "HOSPITAL-NS",
"ctx/health_care_facility|name": "COPD Self Reporting",
"ctx/health_care_facility|id": "9091",  
```

**Notes:**

All of the values on the header should be hardwired, other than `ctx/time`, which should simply record the current dateTime i.e the time that this document was authored in [ISO8061](http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrdict/64316/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003169814.htm) format e.g. `2015-07-15T09:03:36Z`


####  XML source: `patient/protocol/line`

The target archetype / JSON row will depend on the `question` attribute in the incoming `line`.

#### How are you feeling today?

 ##### `line` attributes
 `question`: `How are you feeling today or since your last reading?'

```xml
<line question='How are you feeling today or since your last reading?' alerted='Normal' codevalue='' term='' readcode='[none]' snomed='' resdate='2017-02-08 07:51:01Z' itemindex='0' units='' value='As well as usual' valuetype='Unknown' />

```
##### JSON target:  

```json
  "copd_self_reported_observations/story_history/salford_copd_questions:0/feeling_today_or_since_last_reading|code": "{{value}}",
```

##### Value mappings

| Incoming value       | openEHR value |
|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
| `As well as usual`   | `at0015`      |
| `Better than usual`  | `at0016`      |
| `Worse than usual`   | `at0017`      |


** Notes: **

- `resDate` must be converted to the ISO8601 format (as used by openEHR and FHIR).
  e.g. '2015-07-15 09:03:36Z'	-> '2015-07-15T12:09:03:36Z'

- `resDate` is carried only once for all of the questions, it being assumed that all of the questions are answered at the same date and time.



- The value of `alerted` is ignored for question-like responses and is only carried for the numeric device-derived values.

#### How are you breathing today?

 ##### `line` attributes
 `question`: `How are you breathing today or since your last reading?'

```
##### JSON target:  

```json

```

##### Value mappings

| Incoming value       | openEHR value |
|:--------------------:|:-------------:|
| `Normal for patient`    | `at0018`      |
| `Worse for patient`     | `at0019`      |
